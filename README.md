1. We used pointers to change items in memory, such as the gpas in the arrays.
2. We used const to prevent values from being modified when they shouldn't be.
3. We used references to access and change the original values of items in memory. 
4. We used casting to change data types of values for different purposes, like a string to an integer as an index.
5. We used exceptions to tell the user that they were not using the program properly and something went wrong.
6. We used control flow such as switch statements to have different behaviour based off user input.
